I use python3.6.

You can run my program with './run.sh' to run all the files one by on,
or just use 'python3 hw1_part1_a.py' to test one part of question.
But please know that I choose to show every picture after each part of
the program for obsering the performance(I also save them), maybe you
need to close the picture to let it keep going on.

Assume I can get training data from "data/fashion-mnist_train.csv",
and test data from "data/fashion-mnist_test.csv".

Every variables with pe or Perceptron is used for standard Perceptron.
Every variables with pa or PA is used for Passive-Aggressive algorithm.
Every variables with av or Average is used for averaged Perceptron.

If not mentioned, the variables are used for training.
If the variables have 'test' as part of their name, is used for test.
