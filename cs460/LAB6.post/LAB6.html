                CS460 LAB Assignment #6
                 
                 DUE & DEMO: 11-2-2018

1. References:

   YOUR ksleep(), kwakeup(), kexit() and kwait() functions

   Base code of LAB6.post: 1MB Umode images; SDC driver for getblk()

   Chapter 7.7.6-7.7.7   : Implementations of fork-exec

   Chapter 7.7.9         : Simple sh for command execution
                           INIT process 

2. Requirements:

2-1. Use a SDC containing binary executables in /bin directory.

               /bin -- u1, u2, init, sh

     u1, u2: SAME as before with commands |switch|exit|wait|fork|exec|

     init: Run by P1;                 Read 7.7.9 for INIT algorithm and code

     sh: Run by ANY shChild of P1:    Read 7.7.9 for sh algorithm and code


2-2. Adapt YOUR loader of LAB5 to load Umode image file from the SDC. 


2-3. Let each process Umode image be 2MB, e.g. P1 at 8MB, P2 at 10MB, etc.


2-4. Sample solution: samples/LAB6/t.bin, SDC=disk
