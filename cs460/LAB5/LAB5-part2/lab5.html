                    CS460 LAB5 Assignment
                      DUE: 10-19-2018
PART 1:

Base code: Download files from samples/LAB5.post. Run mk

P1 runs in Umode at PA = 8MB. Its VA range is in [2GB, 2GB + 1MB].
Its Umode menu consists of  |getpid|getppid|ps  |chname|, each is a syscall to
the OS kernel.

1. Add Umode image files u2.c, u2.c, u3.c, u4.c.
   When kerenl starts, let P0 kfork() P1, P2, P3, P4, each excuting a different
   Umode image file u1, u2, u3, u4, respectively.


2. Add the Umdoe commands   |switch|sleep|wakeup|getname|   where
       switch: syscall to switch process
       sleep : syscall to sleep on its own pid value
       wakeup: ASK for a value, syscall to wakeup pid
       getname(char name[64]): syscall to get running proc's name


PART 2: 

Instead of embedding u1 u2 u3 u4 as data sections in kernel image,
copy them as (binary executable) files to the /bin directory of a 
RAMDISK file system using BLKSIZE=1024:

                       disk
                        |- bin
                            |- u1
                            |- u2
                            |- u3
                            |- u4

(1). Use the disk image as a RAMDISK for QEMU:

       qemu-system-arm -M versatilepb -m 128M -kernel t.bin -serial mon:stdio \ 
       -initrd disk
 
    QEMU loads the RAMDISK at 64MB.
		    
(2). When kernel starts, set char *disk = 64MB;

(3). Write a getblk(int blk, char buf[ ]) function, which loads (1KB) disk 
     block blk into a char buf[BLKSIZE]:

           int getblk(int blk, char *buf)

(4). Write a loader(char *filename, PROC *p) function, which loads the contents
     of filename, e.g. /bin/u1, to the UMODE image area of process p.

(5). The system functions should be the same as in PART 1.
