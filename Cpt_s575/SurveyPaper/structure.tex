    \section{Abstract}
        With the development of Artificial Intelligence, various of video games also
        attract a lot of people. This article introduces the application of Artificial
        Intelligence technology in defferent aspects of video games like intelligent virtual
        game roles and the development and promotion of games. And finally discuss the future
        of the application of AI on video games, put forward some direction of the development.
	\section{Introduction}
        Aritificial Intelligence is a kind of technology that can help machine to think or
        act like human. It tells machines how to analyze situations and make corresponding
        actions. In the past, it learn models from developers' codes, what model people write
        down is the behavior it will take. But nowadays, with the appearence of Data Science, it
        start learn models and experience from data. People don't need to enter fixed behavior
        pattern anymore, which make machines more human and rational.\\
        Video games, a kind of game that has attracted countless people since its birth. It depends
        on digital technology and equipments, so AI has a very close relationship with it. From
        its development method, game construction to planning and promotion, also includes the
        basic technology like Virtual Reality, all of these fields are using Artificial Intelligence
        technology and Data Science.
    \section{Development Progress}
        \subsection{What it used to be}
            In the 1980s, the appearence of "Pac-Man" and "Half-Life" set off a frenzy among players.
            But at that time, Artificial Intelligence was not strong enough, so what the game roles
            in "Half-Life" are really simple. It like a single relfection machine that when facing
            with a situation, it will check the if-then rules writen by developers an do the reaction
            according to the if-then rules. So, it looks like a gear, if we don't touch or move it,
            it will not act. These game roles do not have any complex action and only have really
            easy mode of action, it will let players feel so boring. Since when people keep playing
            they will find the game stay the same as before. It also bother the game developers,
            because if they want to let the game to be diversification, they need spend a lot of
            time to enter the reaction rules for the game roles, but it just slows down the players'
            boredom, it does not solve the problem.
        \subsection{The main application nowadays}
            However, the AI technology in video games has become quite developed and has been used
            to a lot of different fields. The most significant difference from the past is that the
            sometimes the virtual game roles are more powerful than humans, like "AlphaStar". It is
            an intelligent robot like "AlphoGo", but it do not know how to play Go, it can play
            "StarCraft II", a really complex real-time strategy adversarial game. Which is not
            possible with the single if-then reflection rules before. Since it has too many status.

        \subsection{Why would have such improvement}
    \section{In Adversarial Games}
        \subsection{Act as a real human}
        \subsection{Analysis how to be a good player}
        \subsection{Defeat the top game player}
    \section{In Checking Cheaters}
        \subsection{Really a struggle}
        \subsection{What can be done is not possible before}
    \section{In Game operation and Promotion}
        \subsection{What makes people want to play a game}
        \subsection{What let the game make money}
    \section{In the future}
        \subsection{Used in game roles}
        \subsection{Used in gaming device}
        \subsection{Used in checking cheater}
