    \section{Abstract}
        With the development of Artificial Intelligence, various of video games also
        attract a lot of people. This article introduces the application of Artificial
        Intelligence technology in defferent aspects of video games like intelligent virtual
        game roles and the development and promotion of games. And finally discuss the future
        of the application of AI on video games, put forward some direction of the development.
	\section{Introduction}
        Aritificial Intelligence is a kind of technology that can help machine to think or
        act like human. It tells machines how to analyze situations and make corresponding
        actions. In the past, it learn models from developers' codes, what model people write
        down is the behavior it will take. But nowadays, with the appearence of Data Science, it
        start learn models and experience from data. People don't need to enter fixed behavior
        pattern anymore, which make machines more human and rational.\\
        Video games, a kind of game that has attracted countless people since its birth. It depends
        on digital technology and equipments, so AI has a very close relationship with it. From
        its development method, game construction to planning and promotion, also includes the
        basic technology like Virtual Reality, all of these fields are using Artificial Intelligence
        technology and Data Science.
    \section{Development Progress}
        \subsection{What it used to be}
            In the 1980s, the appearence of "Pac-Man" and "Half-Life" set off a frenzy among players.
            But at that time, Artificial Intelligence was not strong enough, so what the game roles
            in "Half-Life" are really simple. It like a single relfection machine that when facing
            with a situation, it will check the if-then rules writen by developers an do the reaction
            according to the if-then rules. So, it looks like a gear, if we don't touch or move it,
            it will not act. These game roles do not have any complex action and only have really
            easy mode of action, it will let players feel so boring. Since when people keep playing
            they will find the game stay the same as before. It also bother the game developers,
            because if they want to let the game to be diversification, they need spend a lot of
            time to enter the reaction rules for the game roles, but it just slows down the players'
            boredom, it does not solve the problem.
        \subsection{The main application nowadays}
            However, the AI technology in video games has become quite developed and has been used
            to a lot of different fields. The most significant difference from the past is that the
            sometimes the virtual game roles are more powerful than humans.
            Another application is on the development of the cheating detection mechanism. Cheating
            is really an abomination that most of the players hate these cheating man. If all of
            the cheating in video games can be identified, most of the FPS games will save many
            disappointed players. This is reflected in many of my friends. I used to paly PUBG,
            a famous video game, but there are too many cheaters in this game. With the accumulation
            of disappointment, my friends and I eventually abandoned this game, although it is
            really interesting.
            The third application is in game design and operation. There are so many games nowadays
            and how to make their comanies' games stand out become a severe problem to the game
            developers and operators. The appearence of Data Science has been a big boost. They
            used to use traditional business analysis before, but sometimes it's hard to know what
            can really decide the sales. But Data Science make it be possible for these companies.
            The model from the data can help companies know how to design games that can make
            players keep interested and participating in the games. Also, Artificial Intelligence
            can help game companies know how to design the advertisement and put in them$.^{[1]}$
        \subsection{Why would have such improvement}
            What let human can build such powerful robot now? The development of devices is one of the
            most important reason, because now we have larger memory and faster operators, which
            help our robots can do more things than before. However, another one reason is that
            now we have Data Science, with Data Science, we have ability to analyze the large scale
            data, which contains a lot of information we cannot use before. Also, we can get some
            new models by algorithms.
    \section{In Adversarial Game}
        \subsection{Act as a real human}
        \subsection{Analysis how to be a good player}
        \subsection{Defeat the top game player}
            There is a virtual palyer built by deep learning, called "AlphaStar", it
            has defeated some of the top players in a human way. It is a new robot build by machine
            learning like "AlphoGo", but it do not know how to play Go, it can play
            "StarCraft II", a really complex real-time strategy adversarial game. Which is not
            possible with the single if-then reflection rules before, because this game has too
            many status that even more than Go game. The state space of Go is about $10^{170}$ and
            the state space of "StarCraft II" may have $10^{1685}$. It is far more beyond what
            human can totally think about. Also, it is an incomplete information game, what we should
            consider is almost all of these state every second.
    \section{In Checking Cheaters}
